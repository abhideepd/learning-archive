  There are a lot of insights in this book. Don't agree with most of them. But, I have respect and admiration for Peter Theil. He is a chess player, a natural mathatician as well as a philosophy enthusiast, I can see a dangerious combination of extremely powerful mental model!! The vision/perception/foresight he has about the world and the clarity of thought, will for sure is unignorable. And, he has stood the test of time. You might get lucky once or twice but repetedly so much so, that, you are a "powerful" person in silicon valley, can't simply be luck. So, some stuff, that has stuck with me is:
  
  1. Thinking in terms of contrarian questions, like "what are the truths, very few people agree about ?" or "what are the valueable companies, people are not starting ?". A good mental model, really, and very easy to acquire and view the world.
  2. always try to monopolise, there is no bigger advantage than this. A firm with monopoly, will always show itself as company just surviving, and a business, with lots of competition will go out of their way, to show, how different they are. I have personally seen this behaviour, this really goes on!
  3. compition is for foolish people, always think in terms of edge and monopoly. Actually makes sense, why waste the energy to compete when, we can use this energy to find an edge and monopolise it
  4. All "happy" companies solved a "unique Problem" and earned a Monopoly and all "failed" company are alike, they failed to escape competition.. well, this perspective will surely stick with me. Now I see companies in a more unique way !!
  5. Don't go to war, at the expense of both of you, someone else, will move ahead. Nice way to end rivalry with elon!
  6. Last mover advantage! is true in most of the cases, however, I also believe in the first mover advangage, I guess, for me, its a case by case basis. But but but.... the advice of, reading about endgames, before going for the attack, is golden!
  7. Don't focus / obsess on "disruption"
  8. !!!!!! good design !!!!!! ----> AAPL
  9. 80/20 rule!

  1. One of the shocking things was, to learn, 1 billion $ for instagram was kinda a very good deal, which seemed outragious at that point! The cost of removing competition, "buying magic" because that was the beautiful thing about this app, not engineering or technical stuff
  2. network has incredible value, this just shows, investments from jack, mark anderson etc etc, to name a few, in the tune of 25k, 500k just unimaginable man !!
  3. jack wasn't on instagram and why wasn't he there! and, how, he was the first promoters of this app, that too, due to rivalry
  4. twitter rivalry
