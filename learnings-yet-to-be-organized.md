<summary>What's the difference between Skyscanner, Cleartrip and EaseMyTrip ? </summary>
  <br>
I don't know, a random question popped in my mind. So, I went down the rabbit hole, and found out, that ClearTrip, EaseMyTrip are OTA's and Skyscanner is a metaSearch engine. Basically, Skyscanner is the "google" of OTA's meaning, the relationship is, google with websites => skyscanner with OTA. So, when you are searching and booking flights through OTA's then you are doing through their portal itself, with the payment too, they technically "negotiate" on behalf of you, however, Skyscanner, doesn't take care of your bookings.<br>
